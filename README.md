## Deployment

## Requirements & Specifications
- **Structure:** Focus on full-stack development, incorporating both frontend and backend components.
- **Styling:** Emphasize creativity in UI/UX design. Include a GitHub link in the footer and adhere to UI design principles for a polished look.
- **Functionality:** Develop landing page components, user-friendly search, detailed data display, summary metrics,  portfolio management, and news section.
- **Extras:** Option to save search criteria, supplementary metrics, and responsiveness for optimal viewing across various devices.

## Development Workflow
- **Branch Hierarchy:** Use a three-level hierarchy of branches for promoting changes.
- **Development Branch:** Reflects code for the next release, with all code undergoing testing and peer review.
- **Main Branch:** Updated only from the development branch Pull Requests and reflects the current production release seen by live users.

## Git Strategy
### Pull Requests & Merging
All Pull Requests and code merging will take place in the project's GitHub repo. To reduce merge conflicts, the destination branch should be pulled into the merging branch prior to opening a pull request. After testing changes locally, approve or comment on the PR on GitHub.
### Development Branch
Working branches will be merged into the development branch during weekly development. At least one team member other than the requester must review and approve a request before merging. After successful merge, delete the merged branch from the repository. Resolve any merge conflicts promptly.
### Main Branch
A PR to merge to the main should reflect the goals of the prior week's sprint and produce an updated MVP. All team members must approve a request for merging into the main branch.
